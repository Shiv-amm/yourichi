            <h2>Bleach</h2>
            <p>Ichigo Kurosaki is an ordinary high schooler—until his family is attacked by a Hollow, a corrupt spirit
                that seeks to devour human souls. It is then that he meets a Soul Reaper named Rukia Kuchiki, who gets
                injured while protecting Ichigo's family from the assailant. To save his family, Ichigo accepts Rukia's
                offer of taking her powers and becomes a Soul Reaper as a result.

                However, as Rukia is unable to regain her powers, Ichigo is given the daunting task of hunting down the
                Hollows that plague their town. However, he is not alone in his fight, as he is later joined by his
                friends—classmates Orihime Inoue, Yasutora Sado, and Uryuu Ishida—who each have their own unique
                abilities. As Ichigo and his comrades get used to their new duties and support each other on and off the
                battlefield, the young Soul Reaper soon learns that the Hollows are not the only real threat to the
                human world.

            <h2>One Piece</h2>
            <p>Barely surviving in a barrel after passing through a terrible whirlpool at sea, carefree Monkey D. Luffy
                ends up aboard a ship under attack by fearsome pirates. Despite being a naive-looking teenager, he is
                not to be underestimated. Unmatched in battle, Luffy is a pirate himself who resolutely pursues the
                coveted One Piece treasure and the King of the Pirates title that comes with it.

                The late King of the Pirates, Gol D. Roger, stirred up the world before his death by disclosing the
                whereabouts of his hoard of riches and daring everyone to obtain it. Ever since then, countless powerful
                pirates have sailed dangerous seas for the prized One Piece only to never return. Although Luffy lacks a
                crew and a proper ship, he is endowed with a superhuman ability and an unbreakable spirit that make him
                not only a formidable adversary but also an inspiration to many..</p>

            <h2>Naruto</h2>
            <p>it has been two and a half years since Naruto Uzumaki left Konohagakure, the Hidden Leaf Village, for
                intense training following events which fueled his desire to be stronger. Now Akatsuki, the mysterious
                organization of elite rogue ninja, is closing in on their grand plan which may threaten the safety of
                the entire shinobi world.

                Although Naruto is older and sinister events loom on the horizon, he has changed little in
                personality—still rambunctious and childish—though he is now far more confident and possesses an even
                greater determination to protect his friends and home. Come whatever may, Naruto will carry on with the
                fight for what is important to him, even at the expense of his own body, in the continuation of the saga
                about the boy who wishes to become Hokage.</p>
